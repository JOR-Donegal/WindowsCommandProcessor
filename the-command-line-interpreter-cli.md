In Windows, if you type a command which is not understood, you get a response

_……. is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program, or batch file._

You need to be aware of the computer's response as we are going along. If the computer responds to a command with an error, go back and check the command again, it probably hasn't been carried out.

To find out what version of operating system you are running, In DOS type **ver** and press return\
Note that all commands and file names in DOS are NOT case sensitive.
