# Wildcards

When searching for files (or copying or removing) it can be very handy to use **wildcards**. The (\*) symbol (pronounced splat) is probably the most common.&#x20;

For example in DOS, **dir \*.txt** would return all text files in the working directory.

Because of extensions, wildcards behave a bit differently between DOS and Unix.&#x20;

In DOS the command **dir .com** shows all files ending in .com, these are small programs.&#x20;

The command **dir R\*.txt** shows all files beginning with R or r and with an extension .txt&#x20;

_**\*.\***_ means all files in the working directory&#x20;

## Exercise&#x20;

Delete all files in the CLI/Backup directory, then copy all files from CLI directory to CLI/Backup directory, using wildcards.
