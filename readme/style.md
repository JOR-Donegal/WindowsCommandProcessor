Please practice your command line skills on a test system, not on a production system. Talk to the administrator if you need access to a test system to practice.

In this document, there are several key terms. These will be italicized. You may need to look up these terms to get a full understanding of them. Commands are generally shown in bold.\
In these notes, I will assume your Linux home directory is

/home/username

If you have a different path, adapt!

Generally, these notes show commands in; bold letters or in a separate&#x20;

Be careful, it can be hard to see where the spaces are. If you get an error when you type a command, the chances are you have missed a space somewhere. Linux also uses the “.” symbol in places, for this reason, I leave out full stops on any line which ends with a Linux command.

In DOS/Windows, the characters are not CaSe SeNsItIvE! If you create a file called **Computing.txt**, this is exactly the same file as one called **computing.txt**

There are times when we need to press and hold a control key, or an alt key, and then press a letter. For example, in these notes if I want you to press and hold the ctrl key and then press the letter **d** key, I show it as **\[ctrl]\[d]**.

When you type a command, you run that program and when it terminates, the Command Line Interface (CLI) gives the user another prompt. A user can customize his/her own CLI, and users can use different CLIs open on the same machine. The CLI keeps a list of the commands you have typed in. If you need to repeat a command, use the cursor keys to scroll up and down the list or type history for a list of previous commands.

Microsoft Windows has a graphical user interface (GUI) which provides an easy to use environment. However, knowledge of Windows (via the terminal and its shell) is required for operations which aren't covered by a graphical program, or for when there is no GUI available. Note that it is normal practice to not have a GUI on any production server, Windows Core is the workhorse of data center environments..
