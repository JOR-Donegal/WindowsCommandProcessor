# Create a file from the console

There are several ways of creating a plain old text file from the command prompt. We will use a few techniques here primarily for the exercise value!

Make sure you are in the directory called **CLI**. We are going to create a file with the lines (you need to get this exactly right!!):

_Living easy, living free._\
_Season ticket on a one-way ride._\
_Asking nothing, leave me be._\
_Taking everything in my stride._

To create a file called **rubbish.txt** type **copy con rubbish.txt**

The copy command works as **copy&#x20;**_**source destination**_. In this case the source is the console where you are typing.

You will get a blank line awaiting some input. Type the lines of the sample file and then to save the file, press **\<ctrl>\<z>** when you are finished.

Type **more rubbish.txt** to display the contents of the file.
